COPYRIGHT NOTICE

In this notice, "the program" and "FORMULC" mean the following files:

	README.DOC
	FORMULC.C
	FORMULC.H
	FORMULC.DOC
	TEST.C
	TIME.DOC
	CHANGES.DOC

   They are a unit and must not be distributed individually.

	FORMULC is provided "AS IS", without any implicit or explicit
   warranty. Moreover, I don't assure you that it is useful for any
   specific purpose.

	You can use FORMULC in any of your programs, provided that you 
acknowledge in the documentation of your program that you have used it.
You must mention my name and my E-MAIL address and make clear that
anybody can obtain FORMULC by sending me an E-MAIL. If you modify FORMULC, 
you must state that you have done so before giving your version to any 
other person. I would like to receive the source code of improved versions 
as well as bug reports and suggestions. Questions about the program are 
also welcome, but don't expect to always receive a prompt answer. 
	You can give out as many copies of FORMULC as you want. You cannot
charge a copying fee to anybody without mentioning first that I charge no 
such fee. Moreover, you must ask me for permission to use FORMULC, parts of 
it or a modified version of it in any program you sell or distribute as
ShareWare. 
	I don't want to limit the usage of this program by charging
a compulsory fee. Writing a program takes much time and hard work, but
creating new copies of a program benefits new users without wasting
any scarce resources. If paying a fee would make you decide not to
use FORMULC, then you should rather use FORMULC without paying
than refrain from using FORMULC.
	However, you should see this manner of distribution as an
experiment in honesty. If you want me to be able to continue working on 
and  distributing the program, you should send me a registration fee. If 
you use FORMULC for academic purposes, ca. $10 should be appropriate. If 
you want to sell a program containing parts of FORMULC, you have the legal
obligation to ask me for authorization. I will probably let you use it, 
but the registration fee will be compulsory. The categories for it are as 
follows:

If your program...                        you will have to pay...

  is a project intended for a single        $29
  user or company 

  is a program distributed as ShareWare     $29

  is distributed commercially               $59  

	In any of these cases, the registration fee will enable you
to use any version of FORMULC in all versions of a particular program
of yours. To use FORMULC in two programs you sell, you must pay two
registration fees. When it is not clear what constitutes two different
programs, you should ask the author of FORMULC.
	Paying a registration fee, be it $10, $29 or $59, entitles you
to receive all the new versions of FORMULC in the future, both preliminary 
and definitive. I will send FORMULC to you by E-MAIL or inform you about
the ftp sites where the latest versions of FORMULC are. (This service was
available to all users until the launching of v2.2 (definitive)) In 
answering  questions and suggestions, I will give preferential treatment 
to registered users. 
	Please send suggestions, modified versions, questions, money 
orders or checks to:
