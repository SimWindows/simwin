Differences between this version of FORMULC and the 9/18/94 (v2.1)
release:

1) Now, the stand-alone UNIX filter accepts a third parameter. This
optional parameter specifies the format of the output.

Example:

	formulc "a*b+c" "acb" "%f" <data >results

	data:

	 1 3 2
	 2 0 9
	 4 1 3 
	 1 0 2
	 -2.4 2 3
	
	results:

	5.000000
	18.000000
	13.000000
	2.000000
	-5.200000

2) I have substituted pointers of type Func for pointers of type void *
Now, the declaration of fnew is

int fnew(char *name, Func f, int n_of_pars, int varying);

Func is declared as a pointer to a function with one double parameter.
If the parameter f of fnew is not this type of function, a typecast is
necessary.

(This idea is due to somebody in USENET. I regret having forgotten his
name. If you are this contributor, please send me your name!)

3) FORMULC accepts now random-number generators. Read FORMULC.DOC,
section "Random-Number Generation" for more information.

(This idea is due to Ralf Grosse Kunstleve)
4) Two new functions have been added to the FORMULC interface:

double fval_at(formu function);
void make_var(char var, double value);

5) The exponentation operator has now higher precedence than the unary
minus operator.

        -x^2 means  -(x^2), not (-x)^2
 
Please read FORMULC.DOC.
